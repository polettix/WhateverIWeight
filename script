Basic application idea:

* record weights for people (one weight per day)
* keep data for last month in a "lean" nosqldb
* save all data in a "heavy" sqldb
* provide exporting capabilities

Use cases on the front end:

1. Addition: simple form, write name and weight
2. Consultation: see the data for last month
3. Export: get hystorical data (not immediate) providing username and email

Data format:

* Data are simple and saved twice, one for the frontend and one for
  the regular save by the backend
* Data on frontend are saved only if belonging to the last month
* Different saves are performed:
  * STRING weight:<username>:<date> - keeps weight data by user/date
  * SORTED SET user:<username>:dates - keeps dates using dates
    as score and members
  * SET users - keeps all usernames
* The backend gets the data from a LIST new-weights, encoded in
  JSON and containing both username and weight, used as a queue
* The backend gets the export requests from a LIST export, encoded in
  JSON and containing both username and email, used as a queue

Use cases on the back end:

1. Permanent save: get new data and save in sql database
2. Export: send saved data of user to email

The two activities will be carried out by two different daemons
in the same backend worker


Create a dotcloud.yml build file with the services

   www:
      type: perl
   backend:
      type: perl-worker
   nosqldb:
      type: redis
   sqldb:
      type: mysql

Stuff for backend will be put in a sub and so for the frontend

   $ mkdir backend www


BACKEND

Created a supervisord.conf file inside the backend subdirectory:

   [program:exporter]
   command = perl /home/dotcloud/current/bin/exporter

   [program:saver]
   command = perl /home/dotcloud/current/bin/saver

The "current" subdir in /home/dotcloud always points to the current
instance. The position of supervisord.conf is correct.

The data for connecting to the databases can be found in
/home/dotcloud/environment.json or /home/dotcloud/environment.yml.
Added dependencies for both modules in Makefile.PL.
